    "text": "Keisei Tominaga, from Japan, is captivating audiences with his exceptional basketball skills. He plays for the Nebraska Cornhuskers, delivering remarkable performances both for the Huskers and as a representative of Japan. Earlier this year, he contributed to Japan’s national team, helping them secure a spot in the Olympics for the first time in 48 years since the 1976 Montreal Games. Keisei transferred from Ranger College, a junior college in Texas, adding an element of excitement for Husker fans who had never seen a Japanese player on their team before.\nThe question arises: Does he perform better when playing for the Huskers or for Japan? To analyze this, we’ll compare his performance in various categories for both teams. Keisei played five games for Japan last summer and has participated in four games for the Huskers this season.\nA major factor in his popularity is his remarkable three-point shooting skills, earning him the nickname “Japanese Stephen Curry.” He can make shots from anywhere, be it three-pointers or beyond. Each time he sinks a three-pointer, the crowd erupts with enthusiasm.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(wehoop)\n\nKTperGame &lt;- read_csv(\"~/OneDrive - University of Nebraska-Lincoln/Fall 2023/SPMC350 Fall2023/Blog/Blog2Data/ktpergame - Sheet1.csv\")\n\n\nper3PTSM &lt;- KTperGame|&gt;\n  select(`OPPONENT`,`MIN`,`3PTSM`) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(`3PTSM`))\n\nper3PTSM |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n   cols_label(\n    MIN = \"Minutes\",\n    `3PTSM` = \"Three Points\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Did Keisei Make More Three Points For Nebraska or Japan?\",\n    subtitle = \"Keisei made the most three-pointers for the Japan team, but he made three-pointers consistantly for Nebraska in the last four games.\"\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Miu Takahashi |  **Source:** Keisei Tominaga PerGameData\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n   ) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"blue\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = OPPONENT == \"vs CPV (JPN)\")\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Did Keisei Make More Three Points For Nebraska or Japan?\n    \n    \n      Keisei made the most three-pointers for the Japan team, but he made three-pointers consistantly for Nebraska in the last four games.\n    \n    \n      OPPONENT\n      Minutes\n      Three Points\n    \n  \n  \n    vs CPV (JPN)\n18\n6\n    vs FIN (JPN)\n19\n4\n    vs Rider\n22\n3\n    vs Maine\n20\n3\n    vs Stony Brook\n25\n2\n    vs Oregon St.\n25\n2\n    vs Duquesne\n23\n2\n    vs VEN (JPN)\n14\n1\n    vs GER (JPN)\n13\n1\n    vs AUS (JPN)\n25\n0\n  \n  \n    \n      By: Miu Takahashi |  Source: Keisei Tominaga PerGameData\n    \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nHe made the most three-pointers six times in the FIBA game against Cabo Verde (CPV). This is significant data, as he achieved this feat in the shortest amount of time (18 minutes per game) compared to other games. However, upon examining other rows, it becomes apparent that he consistently makes three-point shots when playing for Nebraska.\nWhat about his accuracy in three-point shooting? There is three-point percentage data for all players at FIBA and Nebraska. Is he also an outstanding three-point shooter compared to the world level?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nFIBA3pt &lt;- read_csv(\"~/OneDrive - University of Nebraska-Lincoln/Fall 2023/SPMC350 Fall2023/Blog/Blog2Data/3PTFIBA - Sheet1.csv\")\n\nNE3pt&lt;-read_csv(\"~/OneDrive - University of Nebraska-Lincoln/Fall 2023/SPMC350 Fall2023/Blog/Blog2Data/NEmbb - Sheet1.csv\")\n\nPTS3FIBA&lt;- FIBA3pt |&gt;\n  select(Name,`3P`,`3PA`)|&gt;\n  arrange(desc(`3P`)) |&gt;\n  top_n(100)\n\nKTPTS3FIBA&lt;-PTS3FIBA |&gt;\n  filter(Name == \"Keisei Tominaga (JPN)‎\")\n\nPTS3NE&lt;- NE3pt |&gt;\n  select(Player,X3P,X3PA)|&gt;\n  arrange(desc(X3P))\n\nKTPTS3NE&lt;-PTS3NE |&gt;\n  filter(Player == \"Keisei Tominaga\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=PTS3FIBA, aes(x=`3PA`, y=`3P`), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_point(data=KTPTS3FIBA, aes(x=`3PA`, y=`3P`), color = \"blue\")+\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=KTPTS3FIBA, \n    aes(x=`3PA`, y=`3P`, label=Name)) +\n  \n  geom_point(data=PTS3NE, aes(x=X3PA, y=X3P), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_point(data=KTPTS3NE, aes(x=X3PA, y=X3P), color = \"red\")+\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=KTPTS3NE, \n    aes(x=X3PA, y=X3P, label=Player)) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Three Points Attempts\", \n    y=\"Three Points\", \n    title=\"Beyond the Arc: Assessing Three-Point Precision\",\n    subtitle=\"The amount of tries that he did shows he is confident about three points.\", \n    caption=\"Source: FIBA.basketball & Huskers Men's Basketball| By Miu Takahashi\"\n    ) +\n   theme_minimal()+\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20,face = \"bold\"),\n       axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10) )\n\n\n\n\n\nThis charts shows top 100 players who made three points and all players on Husker men’s basketball.

Three points percentage is 33% for Nebraska and 37.5% for Japan so there is not a big difference between them. However, he tried more when he played for Japan team.\nIt’s remarkable that both of his datasets rank in the top 100 among over 340 FIBA players. Moreover, he has attempted more three-pointers than any other player, despite playing less than half as many minutes as they have and the average of three points attempts for FIBA is about 23. This demonstrates his confidence in his own skills.\nNow, let’s shift our focus to field goals. What is his field goal percentage for the Huskers and Japan? Does he attempt more for one of the teams? Does he make more for one of them?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nFGFIBAlist &lt;-  read_csv(\"~/OneDrive - University of Nebraska-Lincoln/Fall 2023/SPMC350 Fall2023/Blog/Blog2Data/FGFIBA - Sheet1.csv\")\n\nNEmbb&lt;- read_csv(\"~/OneDrive - University of Nebraska-Lincoln/Fall 2023/SPMC350 Fall2023/Blog/Blog2Data/NEmbb - Sheet1.csv\")\n\nFGFIBA&lt;- FGFIBAlist |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(FGPCT)) \n\nKTFGFIBA&lt;- FGFIBA |&gt;\n  filter(Name == \"Keisei Tominaga (JPN)‎\")\n\nFGNE&lt;- NEmbb |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(FGPCT)) \n\nKTFGNE &lt;- FGNE|&gt;\n  filter(Player ==\"Keisei Tominaga\")\n\nFGFIBA|&gt; \n  ungroup() |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    avgFGM = mean(FGM), \n    avgFGA = mean(FGA)\n    )\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  avgFGM avgFGA\n   &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1   27.7   59.9\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=FGFIBA, \n    aes(x=FGM, y=FGA, size=FGPCT),\n       alpha = .3) + \n  scale_size(range = c(3, 8), name=\"Percentage\")+\n   geom_point(\n    data=KTFGFIBA, \n    aes(x=FGM, y=FGA, size=FGPCT), \n    color=\"blue\") +\n  \n   geom_point(\n    data=FGNE, \n    aes(x=FG, y=FGA, size=FGPCT),\n       alpha = .3) + \n  scale_size(range = c(3, 8), name=\"Percentage\")+\n   geom_point(\n    data=KTFGNE, \n    aes(x=FG, y=FGA, size=FGPCT), \n    color=\"red\") +\n    geom_text_repel(\n    data=KTFGFIBA, \n    aes(x=FGM, y=FGA, label=Name),face = \"bold\",size = 5) +\n   labs(\n    x=\"Field Goal Made\", \n    y=\"Field Goal Attempts\", \n    title=\"Tominaga wouldn't waste any chance.\",\n    subtitle=\"Efficiency Over Volume: Comparable Field Goal Percentage Despite Lower Attempts \", \n    caption=\"Source: FIBA.basketball & Huskers Men's Basketball| By Miu Takahashi\"\n    ) +\n   theme_minimal()+\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20,face = \"bold\"),\n       axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10) )\n\n\n\n\n\nHis field goal percentage is 47% in FIBA games and 45.2% in games for Nebraska. Again, there is not a big difference, but he has already made the same number of field goals in FIBA as he did for Nebraska, even though he has only played four games. That suggests there is a high chance that he plays better for Nebraska than he did for Japan.\nThrough this analysis, he has been playing phenomenally for both Nebraska and Japan. However, the season has just started, marking his last year in college. I have no doubt that he will continue to entertain us this season. We wish Nebraska Basketball the best of seasons."

    "text": "Golf is one of the sports in which people strive to improve. Many individuals would love to know how to emulate PGA tour players, what aspects they need to work on, and the most efficient way to become a great player.\nImagine, for a moment, standing on the green, visualizing each swing with the precision of a grandmaster, just like Collin Morikawa did at the illustrious ZOZO Championship in Chiba, Japan. This tournament, born in 2019, holds special significance for him as a Chinese-Japanese American, with his last name originating from Japan. It was a memorable event for him and his ancestors due to their connection to Japan.\nIn this blog, we will delve into Morikawa’s winning formula and explore what it takes to become a champion, according to the statistical data from the PGA Tour website.\nGolf is a sport where victory isn’t rushed; triumph unfolds over days, not minutes. It is unlike the fast-paced courts of basketball or volleyball and demands endurance and laser focus. It’s a game that rewards those who master the art of patience and concentration.\nLooking at the leaderboard for the tournament, you can already see the hint of why Morikawa became a champion.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(wehoop)\n\navgscore&lt;-read_csv(\"~/OneDrive - University of Nebraska-Lincoln/Fall 2023/SPMC350 Fall2023/Blog/PGA STATS/Avgscore.csv\")\n\navgscore&lt;-head(avgscore,10)\n\ntopavgscore &lt;-avgscore|&gt;select(RANK,PLAYER,R1,R2,R3,R4,`TOTAL STROKES`) \n\ntopavgscore |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \ntab_header(\n    title = \"Is the final round important to be a champion?\",\n    subtitle = \"Morikawa has the best final round in top 10 players.\"\n  ) |&gt; \n    tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Miu Takahashi  |  **Source:** PGATour Stats\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=13)\n     )\n   ) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#D3D3D3\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = R4\n    )\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#FF0000\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = R4,\n      rows = R4 == 63\n    )\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Is the final round important to be a champion?\n    \n    \n      Morikawa has the best final round in top 10 players.\n    \n    \n      RANK\n      PLAYER\n      R1\n      R2\n      R3\n      R4\n      TOTAL STROKES\n    \n  \n  \n    1\nCollin Morikawa\n64\n73\n66\n63\n266\n    2\nEric Cole\n65\n71\n66\n70\n272\n    2\nBeau Hossler\n68\n65\n69\n70\n272\n    4\nRyo Ishikawa\n68\n69\n69\n67\n273\n    4\nRobby Shelton\n65\n72\n71\n65\n273\n    6\nKensei Hirata\n71\n69\n68\n66\n274\n    6\nRyo Hisatsune\n69\n71\n68\n66\n274\n    6\nMin Woo Lee\n69\n73\n67\n65\n274\n    6\nJ.J.

Most of the players who finished in the top 10 played better than they did in the third round on the last day. From the table, we can understand that you need to finish strong and play hard until the end if you want to win.\nNow, let’s get into more detail. What’s the secret sauce behind those jaw-dropping scores? Of course, they need to make many birdies. However, in the PGA tour, all the players have the ability to get birdies. It’s a skill honed to precision. Then, what sets the champions apart from those who fall short, despite their birdie prowess?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nbtb &lt;- read_csv(\"~/OneDrive - University of Nebraska-Lincoln/Fall 2023/SPMC350 Fall2023/Blog/PGA STATS/Birdie to Bogey ratio.csv\")\n\nbtb&lt;-head(btb,10)\n\nnbtb &lt;- btb |&gt; \n  select(PLAYER,`TOTAL BIRDIES AND BETTER`,`TOTAL BOGEYS AND WORSE`) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols=-PLAYER, \n    names_to = \"Score\",\n    values_to = \"Total\"\n  )\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=nbtb, aes(x=reorder(PLAYER, Total), weight=Total, fill=Score)) + \n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Count\", \n    title=\"Offense or Defense: What's More Crucial?\", \n    subtitle=\"Morikawa excels in birdies and minimizes bogeys, a top-tier player.\", \n    caption=\"Source: PGATour Stats| By Miu Takahashi\"\n    ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"red\", \"blue\")) + \n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20,face = \"bold\"),\n       axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10) )\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this data, Morikawa has the most number of birdies and also fewer bogeys compared to other players. It is important to make fewer mistakes and avoid the worst-case scenario in order to beat all players.\nLet’s change the angle. Here’s an easy question: What do you need to make a birdie? It boils down to two essential moves—nailing that approach onto the green and then sinking the putt.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nPutt &lt;- read_csv(\"~/OneDrive - University of Nebraska-Lincoln/Fall 2023/SPMC350 Fall2023/Blog/PGA STATS/Putt.csv\")\n\nCMPutt &lt;- Putt |&gt;\n  filter(PLAYER == \"Collin Morikawa\")\n\nEC &lt;- Putt |&gt;\n  filter(PLAYER == \"Eric Cole\")\n\nBH &lt;- Putt |&gt;\n  filter(PLAYER == \"Beau Hossler\")\n\nRI &lt;- Putt |&gt;\n  filter(PLAYER == \"Ryo Ishikawa\")\n\nRS &lt;- Putt |&gt;\n  filter(PLAYER == \"Robby Shelton\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=Putt, \n    aes(x=`AVG`, y=`GREENS HIT`), color = \"grey\") +\n    geom_point(\n    data=EC, \n    aes(x=`AVG`, y=`GREENS HIT`), color = \"blue\")+\n   geom_point(\n    data=RI, \n    aes(x=`AVG`, y=`GREENS HIT`), color = \"blue\")+\n   geom_point(\n    data=BH, \n    aes(x=`AVG`, y=`GREENS HIT`), color = \"blue\")+\n   geom_point(\n    data=RS, \n    aes(x=`AVG`, y=`GREENS HIT`), color = \"blue\")+\n  geom_point(\n    data=CMPutt, \n    aes(x=`AVG`, y=`GREENS HIT`), color =\"red\") +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=CMPutt, \n    aes(x=`AVG`, y=`GREENS HIT`, label=PLAYER))+\n labs(\n    x=\"Average Putt\", \n    y=\"Greens Hit\", \n    title=\"Crack PGA's Winning Formula with Greens\",\n    subtitle=\"Morikawa has the top level of greens regulations and average putting.\", \n    caption=\"Source: PGATour Stats| By Miu Takahashi\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20,face = \"bold\"),\n       axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10) )\n\n\n\n\n\nMorikawa’s greens hit number is 53, which ranks third, and his average putting is 1.604, ranking second.
