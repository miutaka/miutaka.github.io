    "text": "Golf is one of the sports that people are struggling to be better. People would love to know how to be like PGA tour players, what they need to work on, and what the nearest way to be a great player is.\nImagine, for a moment, standing on the green, visualizing each swing with the precision of a grandmaster, just like Collin Morikawa did at the illustrious ZOZO Championship in Chiba, Japan. This tournament, born in 2019, he is a Chinese-Japanese American so his last name is from Japan. It was a special tournament for him because he and his ancestors are related to Japan.\nIn this blog, we will dive into Morikawa’s winning formula and discover what it takes to become a champion on the greens.\nGolf is a sport where victory isn’t hurried, where triumph unfolds over days, not minutes. It is unlike the fast-paced courts of basketball or volleyball and demands endurance and laser focus. It’s a game that rewards those who master the art of patience and concentration.\nLook at a leaderboard for the tournament and already, you can see the hint of why Morikawa became a champion.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.2     ✔ readr     2.1.4\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.0\n✔ ggplot2   3.4.3     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.2     ✔ tidyr     1.3.0\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(wehoop)\n\navgscore&lt;-read_csv(\"~/OneDrive - University of Nebraska-Lincoln/Fall 2023/SPMC350 Fall2023/Blog/PGA STATS/Avgscore.csv\")\n\n\nRows: 77 Columns: 12\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr  (1): PLAYER\ndbl (11): RANK, MOVEMENT, PLAYER_ID, AVG, TOTAL STROKES, TOTAL ADJUSTMENT, T...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nCode\navgscore&lt;-head(avgscore,10)\n\ntopavgscore &lt;-avgscore|&gt;select(RANK,PLAYER,R1,R2,R3,R4,`TOTAL STROKES`) \n\ntopavgscore |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \ntab_header(\n    title = \"Is the final round important to be a champion?\",\n    subtitle = \"Morikawa has the best final round in top 10 players.\"\n  ) |&gt; \n    tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Miu Takahashi  |  **Source:** PGAStats\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=13)\n     )\n   ) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#D3D3D3\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = R4\n    )\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#FF0000\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = R4,\n      rows = R4 == 63\n    )\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Is the final round important to be a champion?\n    \n    \n      Morikawa has the best final round in top 10 players.\n    \n    \n      RANK\n      PLAYER\n      R1\n      R2\n      R3\n      R4\n      TOTAL STROKES\n    \n  \n  \n    1\nCollin Morikawa\n64\n73\n66\n63\n266\n    2\nEric Cole\n65\n71\n66\n70\n272\n    2\nBeau Hossler\n68\n65\n69\n70\n272\n    4\nRyo Ishikawa\n68\n69\n69\n67\n273\n    4\nRobby Shelton\n65\n72\n71\n65\n273\n    6\nKensei Hirata\n71\n69\n68\n66\n274\n    6\nRyo Hisatsune\n69\n71\n68\n66\n274\n    6\nMin Woo Lee\n69\n73\n67\n65\n274\n    6\nJ.J.

Most of the players who finished in the top 10 played better than the third round on the last day. From the table, we can understand that you need to finish strong and play hard til the end if you want to win.\nNow, let’s get into more detail. What’s the secret sauce behind those jaw-dropping scores? Of course, they need to make many birdies. However, in the PGA tour, all the players have the ability to get birdies. It’s a skill honed to precision. Then, what sets the champions from those who fall short, despite their birdie prowess?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nbtb &lt;- read_csv(\"~/OneDrive - University of Nebraska-Lincoln/Fall 2023/SPMC350 Fall2023/Blog/PGA STATS/Birdie to Bogey ratio.csv\")\n\nbtb&lt;-head(btb,10)\n\nnbtb &lt;- btb |&gt; \n  select(PLAYER,`TOTAL BIRDIES AND BETTER`,`TOTAL BOGEYS AND WORSE`) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols=-PLAYER, \n    names_to = \"Score\",\n    values_to = \"Total\"\n  )\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=nbtb, aes(x=reorder(PLAYER, Total), weight=Total, fill=Score)) + \n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Count\", \n    title=\"Birdie and Bogey Ratio\", \n    subtitle=\"Morikawa excels in birdies and minimizes bogeys, a top-tier player.\", \n    caption=\"Source: PGA Stats| By Miu Takahashi\"\n    ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"green\", \"yellow\")) + \n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20,face = \"bold\"),\n       axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10) )\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this data, Morikawa has the most amount of birdies and also fewer bogeys compared with other players. It is important to make fewer mistakes and avoid the worst case in order to beat all players.\nLet’s change the angle. Easy question. What do you need to make birdie?

Blue dots are the stats for the top 5 players. They are located left top which means they also have the top level of green hits and average putt.\nIn Morikawa’s arsenal, precision reigns supreme. With a greens hit count of 53, he claims the bronze, showcasing his mastery of the approach game. Not to be outdone, his putting average of 1.604 secures him the silver medal in this crucial department. Blue dots are the stats for the top 5 players. They are located left top which means they also have the top level of green hits and average putt."
